# Documentation Overview

The documentation is oriented to both new and experienced Blackhole users.

However, some experience of C++ programming is needed. Users are expected to be
familiar with commonly used STL and Boost components like `std::string`,
`std::vector`, `std::bind` and others. Also it's expected the user to know how
files, sockets, syslog or other backend components work and their limitations.

If this is your first experience with Blackhole, it is recommended to read the
[Design]() overview section to be familiar with main Blackhole's architecture,
concepts and with capabilities.

The [Installation]() and [Tutorial]() sections will help to get started
experimenting with the library. The tutorial gives an overview of the library
features with sample code snippets.

There is also a detailed features description chapter. This part describes
other tools provided by the library that were not covered by the tutorial.
This chapter is best read on a case by case basis.

At last, but not least, there is a [Reference]() which gives the formal
description of library components.
