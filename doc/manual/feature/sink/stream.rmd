# Stream
This sink is designed to work with the `stdout` and `stderr` standard streams.

## Registration
Unlike other sinks this one has the default registration in pair with `string`
formatter. It means that you can configure it and use without further actions.
Yet if you want another formatter with this sink you will register it as others.
For example:

~~~ cpp
repository_t::instance().configure<sink::stream_t, formatter::json_t>();
~~~

The code above register **stream** sink and **json** formatter pair. How to
register another combinations of sinks and formatters check the
[registration rules]() article.

## Configuration

Example:
~~~ cpp
sink_config_t sink("stream");
sink["output"] = "stdout";
~~~

**output** field controls which stream from known by Blackhole can be used.
Only 2 values are available `stdout` and `stderr`.

## Example

The simplest example of `stream`-sink usage you can find in [tutotial]()
section.
