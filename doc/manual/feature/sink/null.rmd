# Null
If you need to push log message to nowhere this sink is your choice. Why you
may need so? For testing purpose or in benchmarks for example.

This is a thread-safe sink.

## Registration

Registration code looks like follows:

~~~ cpp
repository_t::instance().configure<sink::null_t, formatter::string_t>();
~~~

The code above register **null** sink and **string** formatter pair. How to
register another combinations of sinks and formatters check the
[registration rules]() article.

##Configuration

Sink doesn't have any configuration parameters, you just need to create object
with **null** type

~~~ cpp
sink_config_t sink("null");
~~~

## Example
In development.
